<h1>My Resume</h1>
<h3>which needs to be updated</h3>
<p class="nobrpls">I left Infogix in 2009, right when my father was given two serious medical diagnoses at the same time. I relocated (temporarily) to Texas to help with all that, and ultimately with probate and liquidating the estate. When finally able, I took on clients as an Independent Consultant / Contractor.

My client since 2014 is a large, member-owned health insurer. There, I assessed, designed, certified, and deployed a series of automated controls to track amounts in specific sets of patient transactions. They also confirm each of these millions of transaction got posted and acknowledged, via reports and dashboard grapics. Going forwared these controls will serve as model objects which the client will adapt and deploy to several other patient-group transaction sets that are similar in nature.

And with that, here is my resume up through my lengthy tenure at Infogix.
