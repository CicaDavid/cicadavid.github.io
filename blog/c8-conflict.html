    <p class="nobrpls">Ten days with my family on vacation: the opportunities for conflict were many. On our last full day, I diligently skipped a trip to Scarborough Beach so I could work on my Week 8 DBC tasks. We were meant to meet afterward for ice cream so when I got word they were heading back, I showered and walked their dog down to the meet up point as planned. 

    Only to discover that my brothers were already off to the grocery store and my sisters-in-law were focused on shopping at the pet store next door to the ice cream parlor. I handed over the dog and after about 5 minutes cooling my heels, I walked back to the house in a huff. As usual, I thought about why I was mad and examined whether it was merited. I think of this as "vetting the indictments".

    I was mad because I had planned to suggest we go to the grocers after ice cream; I wanted certain items for our picnic later, and I badly needed cash. Now, many wrenches suddenly thrown into my schemes. 

    As my mood was noticeably bad, I did tell one brother who asked why that I didn't like how they had unilaterally changed the plans without at least informing me, if not consulting me. I also resented the time wasted walking the dog down to the ice cream shop when, as it turned out, everybody had first stopped at the house on the way.

    In retrospect, I could have responded to their "we're on our way to the ice cream shop" text with one of my own advising my desire to go to the grocers afterward. Then we might have avoided much of the conflict. I guess I learned that, even though they should have informed me about the change in plans, I should have mentioned how I was relying on that plan being stable.

    As families do, we moved past it with no lingering issues. My other brother never made mention of it and I assume he just wrote it off to me being cranky. Meanwhile, I can say that while I was in my huff I used the time to get all my packing done. At least I channeled the energy into something productive instead of wallowing.

    I find that this kind of worthy distraction helps occupy me while my subconscious mind sorts out my feelings on the matter.
