  <h2>I say a little prayer for you...</h2>
  <h4>14 June 2015</h4>

      If you've always wanted to learn a little bit of Polish, today's post title lets you cross that item off your bucket list. I learned it from a tiny plaque that once hung in my Polish auntie's kitchen. No surprise then, it means "Kitchen Prayer".

      Applied to the theme of DBC Culture, my hope is we are all poised to cook up a great DBC experience that will enrich ourselves and enrich one another as well. It seems more apt to conceive DBC as grocer than a restuarant. The freshest ingredients are provided in a logical order, but then it falls on us to cook up something magical.

      I heard a lot of "me me my" recommended in the first mintues of video we watched -- and that made apprehensive until I heard it put into its full context. (One supposes that DBC has some reserve measures in place to ensure that the creative maelstrom doesn't degenerate into anarchy!)

      I look forward to wading in deeper in Week 2, but I suspect the crazy fun doesn't hit its stride until on-site begins.  Until then, I'll remember you all in my modlitwa kuchenna!
