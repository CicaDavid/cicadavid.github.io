    <p>In many ways my Thinking Style is !abstract-random. In the word quads our styles are tested by, the AR marker word is often my first choice to eliminate. If there is an elimination. Much of the time I like all four words.

    </p>
    <p>My tendency is to organize some list, but making sure to tag items -- for practical experimentation, or abstract thinking on how to define them and their behaviors. My biggest struggle has been time. This week has been a relief.

    <p>For me, the way DBC organizes our information helps me to evaluate the workload and steps. Checking out the suggested material usually gives me an idea on what things I might like to experiment on or contemplate. 

    </p>
    <p>I have to become more disciplined about when its okay to get drawn into those rabbit-holes of "i wonder what if... experimentation.  As time grows my time-blocking skills, I see I'm doing better. 
      
    </p>
    <p>I'd like to reflect further on what I could learn from how natural Abstract Random types process the same information and address tasks similar to my own undertakings. First blocks and now chunks!
