  <h2>So Far, Talk Is Cheap</h2>
  <h4>11 July 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p>As a career-long member of the highest and most overrepresented demographic in the tech sector, I wanted to explore the question: what’s working so far in our nascent quest for greater diversity in sector employment practices?  Sadly, not much. Many in the industry would talk about the efforts they’re making. They tie poor results to a lack of talent in the pool. But are they looking?

    </p>
    <p>African American employment in the tech sector has declined as H-B1 visa approvals have increased in the last five years. A<a href="http://www.jetmag.com/talk-back-2/why-whitewashing-diversity-in-tech-is-a-big-problem/">Jet Magazine article</a> takes the sector to task, accusing it of seeking overseas talent instead of investing in domestic professionals of color. In answer to claims that the tech sector cannot find talent within underrepresented communities, the article notes African Americans have the second highest rate of Computer Science degrees after whites.

    </p>
    <p>A recent<a href="https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/28/new-diversity-reports-show-the-same-old-results">NY Times bog post</a> is equally skeptical of the sector’s claims, quoting diversity group spokesman Wade Henderson.  He wryly observes that “these companies also employ accountants, lawyers, administrative support and professionals from other fields where there are massive pools of talent in communities of color.” 

    </p>
    <p>The Times blog post closes with this challenge to the sector from Catherine Bracy, director of community organizing at Code for America:<br/>
    "If these companies can create self-driving cars and bring Internet to the entire world, it’s not that hard to hire more than one black woman per year.”
