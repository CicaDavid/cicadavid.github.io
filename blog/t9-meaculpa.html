  <h2>Reflections on my website</h2>
  <h4>16 August 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p class="nobrpls">Not as an excuse but by way of explanation, I have worked full time &mdash; as a software developer &mdash; for most of Phase 0. Except for Week 8 when I was on a family vacation. Back to reality, I have just worked my last week including hours on Saturday and Sunday, because I had code moving into production. Even during Phase 1 week 1, I am on "retainer". But by sometime this coming week I'll finally be working only for me and DBC.

    Back when, I began my website with good intentions that I was unable to deliver. After the excitement of getting it up and running, I turned my attention to some sample websites and observed that my initial website plans would yield nothing like what I see now are new and "modern" trends for webpages. I kept up with the task work but didn't invest nearly the amount of time as I have seen put in by so many of my colleagues to their own sites.

    I'll have to scrap my current site and rebuild it from scratch, more or less. Since I have so much time invested in the blog entries, though, I'll save the content in those and reoffer them in a new style. Under these circumstances I won't want to waste any of my colleague's time on feedback for the site as is. Instead my intention, for the time I would allocate to this challenge, is to go back to square one and create a new action plan and create brand new wireframes etc.

    So, most of my colleagues have quite a head start on their websites; but they'll do wise to peek over their shoulder going forward...  because starting next week, here I come!
