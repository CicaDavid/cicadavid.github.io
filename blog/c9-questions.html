    <p class="nobrpls">Since 1999 my technology worklife has centered around automated controls on data flows and content. I most cases, the controls are bolted on as an afterthought, so the process typically begins with an assessment. Which is a fancy word for asking lots of questions. Thus I can claim to have worked many years and earned plenty of money as a professional question asker.

    Some of the things I learned are simple and intuitive... the trick is not knowing them but rather keeping them in mind. First and foremost, after you receive an answer, confirm that the answer given was for the question asked. Many times, people answer a different question. Second, reconfirm again later in the conversation. It's surprising what seeps into someone's subconscious mind while they're busy answering your other questions.

    Be specific. In real life, form your questions as specifically as possible and define any terms you use so that you and the responder both have the same understanding. Imagine someone was going to read a transcript of your fact-finding session. Don't assume they know anything, and proceed accordingly to explain what you ask, to clarify the response you get, to attack all of the areas for follow up questions, and in the end, summarize what you believe you have heard and ask for confirmation.

    Be specific is good advice for web queries as well. For one thing, it will give the persnickty folks less to comment on. "Technically, you should say..." seems annoyingly common in some of the reponder comments on sites like Stack Overflow. Although many are not kind in doing so, they nevertheless make a good point. Your questions should be concise, unambiguous, and as focused as possible.

    In web searches, think of words you might use to filter your answer and include them. Or exclude them. Only this morning my inital search for a bit of javascript returned many more answers involving "jquery". As far as I know, jquery info is not helpful so I restated the query to exclude and got a more focused set of results. Sadly, none of which solved my problem which apparently was wishful thinking!

    Now that I've written this far, I went and read the first resource given in the challenge and I think it is an excellent summary. One thing I would add is: use active voice. Instead of "after the array is sorted..."  say "after I sort the array...". Active writing is shorter and easier to read. You can read more about active/passive voice but in a nutshell, avoid using "to be".
