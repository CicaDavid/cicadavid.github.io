    <p class="nobrpls">By and large, we are what we are. I'd like to be taller but no matter how I aspire to that, I'm shrinking if anything. While we have to accept most of our physical traits, we make some degree of choice when it comes to character traits; we can develop and display those we admire, while supressing those we wish to shed or minimize.

    From a laundry list of 100 values, I find many that resonate with me, but for today's post I selected this list of 10: accomplishment, courage, creativity, decisiveness, honesty, insight, leadership, loyalty, self-knowledge, serenity, will power, wisdom. Some are of utmost importance to me; I abhor disloyaty. I appreciate creativity. I am decisive. Others I aspire to: wisdom, serenity, courage -- many days I do well and at times I stumble.

    At work, younger team members often ask my advice on how to respond to situations. They are perhaps reacting to the leadership I project, and they must believe I have wisdom to share. If I look inward and think about my own situation, I believe the sterotype I would be most apt to battle is the idea that "you can't teach an old dog new tricks." So in response to that, I would remind myself that I am creative, and that I have a long history of professional accomplishment. As long as the stereotyper's mind is open I should be able to demonstrate these qualities and shut down any "old dog" concerns.

    In fact, as I am fond of saying (now more than ever) -- maybe that just means us old dogs have already seen all the tricks and the young pups have nothing much new to teach us!
