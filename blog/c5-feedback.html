  <h2>My take on these didactic elements...</h2>

    Easier to receive than to give? I was gratified by most of the feedback I received, and if I’m honest the one slightly sour note was not too difficult to swallow. I can’t say that particular bit of feedback helped my learning in any way; it simply underscored that people have different appetites for socializing, some preferring things more amiable while others preferring an all-work-no-play environment. Both points of view are valid and this is a matter of style not substance. That being said, it falls on each partner to communicate when and if the style of interaction starts to drift away from their preferred set point.

    </p><p>In contrast, for me writing feedback is much more difficult… not the kindness part or the specificity. I struggle to find something actionable that bears mentioning. Maybe I still conceive of feedback as “constructive criticism” and perhaps that’s not the right mindset. At this stage, I wish I could peruse a rich list of examples showing “good” feedback to see what veins I’m not tapping into. Frankly I was confused by the “correct” answer in this week's Quiz…  to me that example seemed to say “you did great, while I need to brush up on…”, which doesn’t strike me as being very actionable for the person who received it.

    </p><p>Turning from feedback to pairing, I very much like the pairing approach for a couple reasons. It’s great for relationship building and at the same time developing fluency with lots of new technology terms and concepts. That should pay dividends during the interviewing process this fall. Moreover, pairing offers so many chances to learn by seeing how other people approach tasks, or by hearing about some method or other techno-thing your pair knows that you don’t.

    </p><p>Though pairing is not entirely a bed of roses. On a couple occasions, my mind will have suddenly gone blank or I've been vexed by not being able to find some window or other thing that needs clicking. This frustrates me because I feel like I am appearing oafish to my partner and not showing my normal competency. With some partners we both laugh it off but with others I just try to relax and move quickly past it -- and hope no one noticed!

    </p><p> In conclusion, pairing is a solid component of the learning program we are undertaking and I look forward to more of it. I feel that the feedback component is a little more forced and hasn’t demonstrated a lot of value yet, but my mind remains open and I do make a sincere effort to give ASKy feedback to my pair partners. If only it were less of a struggle.
