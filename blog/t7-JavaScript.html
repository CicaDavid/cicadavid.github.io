  <h2>This, and That</h2>
  <h4>1 August 2015</h4>

  <section>
    <p class="nobrpls">Let's compare, and contrast, two elements of the Ruby and Javascript programming languages: looping, and documentation. 

    We'll start with the bitter, which is to say that the Ruby<a href="http://ruby-doc.org/">core documentation</a> is a treat compared with my experiences thus far with the Mozilla docs for<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">Javascript</a>. Ruby docs seem better organized, are more clearly written, and report correct information. 

    Whereas Javascript docs are less well organized, less concisely written, and describe some methods that (so far) I haven't been able to deploy successfuly under the Node framework. My opinion may change as I gain familiarity with the Mozilla docs. I will give them credit for self-rating commentary; the docs include symbols to indicate important information including my favorite: "this deprecated API should no longer be used, but will probably still work." Hilarious. I should also underscore how much I do like both the content and writing at<a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/">eloquentjavascript.net</a>.

    With that out of the way, Ruby and Javascript offer a similar menu of looping methods with one vital difference... Javascript restores to me my much beloved For loops, beside which the .times method in Ruby is a pale imitation. Start where you like, end where you like, increment or decrement the iterator by whatever factor you like. Now you're looping! The ability to count down in a loop is such a basic and powerful construct, it surprises me that Ruby doesn't at least offer that. (In a straightforward way.)

    I think many would agree that the For loop syntax is easier to read, easier to comprehend, and keeps code much tidier than building a similar machine in Ruby using While constructs. Meanwhile, in fairness to Ruby, Ruby does provide many useful iterator methods that Javascript does not. So Javascript's better iteration tools in part form a much needed spackle to help cover Javascript's lack of built in iterator methods that are powerful and useful, as we do find in Ruby.
