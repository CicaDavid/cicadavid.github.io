  <h2>Why, how, where...?</h2>

      Version Control as discussed here is the disciplined practice followed by developers to monitor and manage changes to software and related components. They do so because Version Control provides three main benefits:</p><ul>
      <li>reversion</li>
      <li>distribution</li>
      <li>documentation</li></ul>
      <p>Incorrect changes can be reversed easily and then resolved appropriately. Large efforts can be broken into small, manageable tasks that many decentralized resoures (developers) can work on concurrently. VC tools typically require developers to document the why and what of each change they promote, which creates an ongoing record that in turn supports auditing and other due diligence business activities. Naturally, developers have developed many different VC environments, one of which is Git.

      Git provides tools that automate and apply discipline to the practice of creating working copies of original objects, tracking changes to the working copy, commiting vetted changes and then integrating the changes along with their documentation back into the now-updated original object. Git keeps track of branches (copies), their status, and process updates including resolution of conflicts between competing changes to the same object. Git can readily exchange content back and forth with GitHub.

    <p>
      Through that mechanism, GitHub connects the isolated environs of "your computer" to a large and social developer community. The Hub offers cloud storage of code repositories, moderates integration of changes pushed to repositories, and also hosts websites and blogs. Plus, your profile page encourages participation by graphically depicting activity and posting your stats.
