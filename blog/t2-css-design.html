    <p>Class and ID appear to the unitiated as the same thing, only different. One is tied to a hashtag characcter, the other a dot but besides that, they both are used to mark and define style. They are both called out by name when tags use either of them. They look nearly the same in CSS code.

    </p><p>And that's true on the surface. But dig a little deeper and we learn the hastag comes with a price. Those IDs are individually tracked by the browser so it can jump to the elements with IDs. On top of the overhead that comes with that, we get limitations. On any given page only one element can use a specific ID. And any element can only use one ID. No stringing IDs together for compound effect. One element can have both an ID and class(es) though. So do use an ID when you want to mark that one specific page element... that's what it is for.

    </p><p>If not, time to get CLASSy.</p>
