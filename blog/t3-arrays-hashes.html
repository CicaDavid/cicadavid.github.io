    <p>As we found with Class and ID, Arrays and Hashes are more similar than different. They hold the same data in the same way. Where they differ is in how you refer to members in the Array or Hash.

    </p>
    <p>Array members are called out by the number of their slot in the array, with [0] calling out the first and [n] or [-1] calling out the last. Since array members are called and ordered by the natural number set, moving through arrays is easily iterative. Pinpointing specific members is clearcut.

    </p>
    <p>What is not so clear is that my_array[3] contains my age. Or is that my IQ? When the array makes sense as a data structure -- perhaps akin to a data table row -- a hash lets you define the callout as any legal object. So you can use a string like "age" and then your code references for this element's value become self-documenting:  bar_age = mydata[age]-10.  The hash is "ordered" in the same order as the hash objects are added.

    </p>
    <p>
    An array of Hashes should be effectively the same as a database table, where the array index is the table row number and the the hash is the data values for that row, addressed by their "column" names. Whereas Class and ID are in opposition to one another, Arrays and Hashes work hand in hand.</p>
