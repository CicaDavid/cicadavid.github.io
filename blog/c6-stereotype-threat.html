  <h2>A Correlate of Diversity</h2>
  <h4>25 July 2015</h4>

    <p class="nobrpls">Stereotype Threat was a completely new subject when I woke up today, not part of my direct experience. Intuitively, the claims about its effects seem reasonable, just as when athletes get "psyched out" during competition. My lack of awareness no doubt demonstrates the validity of one commentator's admonishments about a new book on the topic: "make sure your white men get a copy of it." Ouch.

    I thought I would explore criticisms of the theory and studies of it, not because I dispute anything but just to examine that aspect. The charges include lack of study control groups, failure to reproduce test findings, publishing self-bias, as well as attribution to other causes such as test anxiety.

    Even if the studies are flawed, they have helped to both clarify who is vulnerable and what circumstances are likely to provoke matters. In the end, although it's effects seem difficult to measure satisfactorily, we can't entirely dismiss the effects of Stereotype Threat; it is but another aspect of the overall diversity problems that plague the STEM sector. As with other parts of the diversity domain, research related to Stereotype Threat must shift more of its focus to understanding what methods are effective in reducing Stereotype Threat's impact in the workplace.
