<h1>Tidbits from my backstory</h1>
<p>I was born into the Navy while my father was stationed at Pearl Harbor and that's why I first learned how to walk on a beach, which partly explains my walk. From the beaches of Hawaii to sunny, orangey California for the rest of my first decade and then ultimately to Chicagoland. Even at that age I realized my parents had orgainized their plan backwards.

</p><p>After High School years that I remember fondly, I went on to receive degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana and have since enjoyed a career in Information Technology. I paid for most of that education with my earnings doing software development over summers and breaks. In my early professional life, I had the opportunity to create the first self-running animated demonstration to ship with a PC... 

</p><p>...well, personal computers were new and very novel (and very ex$pen$ive) back then. I don't think at the time I appreciated the opportunity to grab a "first" as I do now. Besides doing software development and IT management, I have consulted many times over the years and also taken successful turns at sales and customer relationship management. 

</p><p>When I'm not being professional I like to spend time -- when it's not freezing -- outdoors. Or working on a painting. (I enjoy torturing myself with watercolors and I do take paid commissions. And have gotten some.) Yet, I sing very badly. Shove me towards the back if birthday cake is heading our way.
